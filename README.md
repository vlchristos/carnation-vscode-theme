# Carnation Theme for VS Code

A dark theme for VS Code with a touch of... carnation!
There are three versions inclued: **Carnation**, **Carnation Frameless** and **Carnation Flat**.

Syntax highlighting is borrowed from GitHub's VS Code theme as well as the the inspiration for the theme color scheme.

### **Enjoy!**
